## Overview
This project is a team project to create online digital resources for an learning institution. This Whitecliffe Digital Resources project is a group project. I worked as the front-end and UI designer. 
I prioritized the key search function first, as in most cases students type a keyword, like in a google search engine. 
The application is simple with intuitive design, so the student can easily search and locate the article they require. 
We built this application with Django web framework and MongoBD as the database.
